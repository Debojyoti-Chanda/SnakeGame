# Snake Game in C#

This is a simple console-based Snake Game implemented in C#. The goal is to navigate the snake, eat food, and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. The game gets faster as you collect more food.

## Features

- **Console-based interface**: The game runs in the terminal/console.
- **Simple mechanics**: Use arrow keys to control the snake.
- **Score tracking**: Your score increases as the snake eats food.
- **Difficulty increases**: The game speed increases after each food is consumed.
- **Game over logic**: Game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
